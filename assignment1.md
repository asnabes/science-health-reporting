## Story idea 1

How common is it for health care workers in Michigan to become sick with COVID-19? According to [a BuzzFeed article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/us-health-care-workers-coronavirus) updated on Friday, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services does not know how many health care workers in the state have coronavirus. I can ask the department if they now know how many health care workers have COVID-19. I would calculate the percentage of people in Michigan with COVID-19 who are health care workers. BuzzFeed [found](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emmaloop/coronavirus-detroit-nurses-doctors-employees) that 2,772 workers at five health systems in Michigan have COVID-19 or are “suspected” to have it, but this is only the data for some health systems in the Detroit area. 

I also would like to find out which medical professions are contracting COVID-19 at the highest rates. Perhaps, there’s a higher percentage of nurses contracting the disease than doctors, for example. 

The story I will critique is titled, [“16% of Ohio’s coronavirus cases are healthcare workers.”](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/16-of-ohios-coronavirus-cases-are-healthcare-workers.html)


**Clarity and accuracy:**

Identifying the central insight the reporter is communicating: 5

The reporter is saying that on March 25, 16% of people with coronavirus in Ohio work in health care. The central insight is in the headline.

Ability to quickly understand how to navigate the data: 5

The most efficient way to navigate the data is to read and view the chart. I don’t think the reporter needs to improve navigation of the data. 

Accuracy of the data: 3

I question the accuracy of the 16% statistic, because a disproportionately high number of health care workers are likely being tested for coronavirus. I bet health care workers are more likely than people in other fields to be tested for coronavirus, which means that the 16% number may be higher than the actual number of health care workers with the disease. The reporter cited the Ohio Department of Health’s director. The only other way they could verify the data is by contacting all health care systems in Ohio, which would take too much time. The reporter explains what needs to be explained and she says, “More healthcare workers are tested for the disease…” The reporter should have explained more of the reasons for the high number of health care workers contracting the disease, though. 

I also question the accuracy of the data about age in the chart, as not enough people were being tested on March 25. In addition, the chart caption does not say where the data comes from, which is bad. I assume it’s from the Ohio Department of Health, as that’s the source of the data described in the article. 


**Quality:**

The chart was made with a decent degree of quality. I rank it a 3. I think the idea of making a bar graph to represent different age groups is a good one. I also saw this kind of chart in the Detroit Free Press. I think the title of the chart (“Age Distribution of Ohio Cases”) is good, because it clearly tells you that the graph is focusing on age. The title of the y axis is also good. I do not like, however, how the percentages for different age groups are presented. The size of the percentage numbers is too small. The numbers are also presented vertically, so you may have to tilt your head to read them. Perhaps they could have put the percentages in the bars for each age group. Additionally, I think the age group numbers (such as “0-19”) should be horizontal, not vertical.  

The chart accomplished all tasks, except correlating. The chart tells me that the two age groups in Ohio with the highest percentage of COVID-19 cases are 50-59 and 60-69. The article does not mention this fact, though, and does not explain why many of the people with COVID-19 are older adults. 


**Type and color:**

I don’t think the reporter used type to its best purpose. The font looks like it may be Calibri, which is the automatic font in Excel. The font is easy to read, but perhaps the reporter could have used one that is more original. I recently worked on a story with a data reporter, and she wanted to make her own graph instead of using my Excel graph.

The Cleveland.com reporter did use color to its best purpose, though. The colors look like they belong together, as they are all reddish or pinkish tones. The colors do draw my attention to the most important information, because the bars for the two age groups with the highest number of cases are a darker color. 

The colors make sense, as age groups with similar percentages are the same color. Age groups with low numbers are one color, age groups with a medium number are another color and age groups with a high number are yet another color.

I rank the colors a 5, because they are all of a similar color tone and they are sorted in a logical way. I rank the type a 4, because the font is easy to read, but unoriginal.


**Creativity:**

The chart is the only creative element in the article, but the journalist uses it to good effect. It clearly shows you the percentage of coronavirus cases that are in each age group. It could draw someone in, especially if they’re wondering why so many people between 50 and 69 are getting coronavirus. However, the article does not use enough creative elements. Perhaps, the reporter could have made another chart showing how the percentage of people with coronavirus in Ohio who are health care employees compares to other states.

I give the effectiveness of the creative element a rank of 4. The main problem with the chart is that it has nothing to do with the headline. 


## Story idea 2
My second idea is to do a story about the demographics of unemployed people during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics [published](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) demographic data for people who were unemployed in March. The unemployment rate changed the most for Hispanics and Asians between February and March. Why is that? Unemployment also increased for white and black people, but by fewer percentage points than it did for Hispanics and Asians. Perhaps people of certain racial or ethnic groups are more likely to be in essential fields, and thus are less likely to be laid off. I also would like to look at the April data once it comes out. 

This is the question my story would address: Is unemployment growing more among certain racial and ethnic groups than others?

The article I will critique is titled, ["How the coronavirus job cuts played out by sector and demographics."](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-jobs/how-the-coronavirus-job-cuts-played-out-by-sector-and-demographics-idUSKBN21M0EL)


**Clarity and accuracy:**

Yes, I was able to identify the reporter’s main insight. I rank the article a 5 in this category.
According to Dan Burns, many people became unemployed in March, and some demographics, such as teenagers and people in their early 20’s, saw higher increases in their unemployment rates than others. The headline relates to this. It says, “How the coronavirus job cuts played out by sector and demographics.” A U.S. News & World Report headline says, [“Virus Job Losses Hit Young, Minorities First,”](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2020-04-03/young-and-minority-workers-feeling-first-effects-of-coronavirus-unemployment) which is better than the Reuters headline, because it explains how exactly the pandemic is affecting unemployment for different demographics. 

Ability to quickly understand how you would navigate the data: 3

* To access the charts, you have to click on a link. This is not the most efficient way to navigate the data.

* I think the charts should appear in the article.

* There is also data in the text of the article, and I think the reporter writes about the data clearly.

Accuracy of the data: 3.5

* The journalist, Dan Burns, writes, “even that massive number - the largest since the financial crisis 11 years ago - did not capture the true depth of the losses because the monthly survey was conducted too early in March.” Therefore, the unemployment data is inaccurate, because it may not include people who became unemployed at the end of March. 

* The reporter could check with state labor bureaus, but that would take a lot of work, because they would have to contact 50 states and Washington D.C.

* The reporter provided the source of the data: the U.S. Department of Labor.

* The reporter presented a lot of statistics but didn’t give reasons for the statistics. For example, why are so many teenagers unemployed?


**Quality:**

Was it executed at a high degree of quality? Rating: 4
The story was well-written and told me about a variety of unemployment demographics, ranging from amount of education to race. The graphs could be better, though. First of all, readers shouldn’t have to click on a link to see the graphs. Second of all, the first graph includes both negative and positive numbers, which is confusing. The reporter should have not included “government” and just shown the fields where unemployment grew. This would have allowed the bars to be pointed up instead of down. It looks weird to have a bar graph pointing down.  

The graphics accomplished all tasks.


**Type and color:**

The reporter kind of used type to its best purpose. The graphics’ font is good. It’s easy to read. The sub-head and the title for the y-axis are too small, though. 

The reporter did not always use color to its best purpose. In the “Which sectors lost jobs in March?” graph, I think the reporter could have chosen colors that more closely relate to the different fields. For example, I don’t associate manufacturing with green — that would be a better color for fields that relate to nature. Manufacturing could have been black. 

I give type a rank of 4, because the reporter used a good font, but some of the text in the graphics is too small.

I give color a rank of 4.


**Creativity:**

The story used creative elements to good effect, because the graphics show you large differences in the unemployment data for different groups. For example, one graphic titled, “Unemployment across age and race,” shows that the percent of 16- to 19-year-olds that are unemployed increased by about 3.3%, while the percent of 25- to 34-year-olds who are unemployed increased by about 0.4%. 

I rank the effectiveness a 4.
