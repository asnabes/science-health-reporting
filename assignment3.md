# Assignment 3
How often does Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer use the word “data” in each of her press conferences during the coronavirus pandemic? I noticed that in Monday’s press conference, Whitmer used the phrase, “data-driven.” Whitmer is using data when deciding when to re-open the state, she has said in press conferences. Has she used the word more or less overtime? She said “data” six times during Monday’s press conference, while she used the word once or not at all in two press conferences in March. 

This data could turn into a story if I interview a member of Whitmer’s communications team and ask why she has been using the word so much lately. One of my professors last quarter, Peter Slevin, said you can track a politician’s rhetoric and write a story about it. This article would be an example of that. Some people do not like Michigan’s stay at home order — including the members of [a large protest in Lansing on April 15](https://www.freep.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/15/lansing-capitol-protest-michigan-stay-home-order/5139472002/). Whitmer may be using the word “data” to emphasize that she’s making informed decisions and that restrictions are necessary.  

I would like to know these facts about each data point:
* The date of Gretchen Whitmer’s press conference.
* The number of times she used the word “data” during the conference.
* The number of cases of COVID-19 in Michigan on that day.
* The number of COVID-19-related deaths in Michigan on that day. 
* Whether Michigan’s coronavirus curve was rising, peaking or decreasing on that day.

I would listen to Gretchen Whitmer’s press conferences to learn how many times she uses the word “data.” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun also speaks at the conferences, but I decided that I only need to listen to what Whitmer says. I will not count mentions of “data” by Khaldun in my dataset. I found out whether the curve is rising, peaking or decreasing from [the website for University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/michigan) and from my mom, who is a surgeon. I found out the number of cases and deaths in Michigan from The New York Times’ [coronavirus dataset](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv). 

Here is the link to [my dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-MejGJ67xME1QCvhc_QIgELr_baKl4spYrKVr0dD4BE/edit#gid=0).
