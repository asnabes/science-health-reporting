# Final Project Pitch
My final project will look at the demographics of unemployment data for March and April. The news hook is that many people are unemployed because of the coronavirus pandemic, and I bet readers would want to know if some demographic groups have seen greater changes in their unemployment rates than others. 

I will answer this question: Are certain racial, ethnic and gender groups disproportionately becoming unemployed during the pandemic? The lede of [a Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-jobs/how-the-coronavirus-job-cuts-played-out-by-sector-and-demographics-idUSKBN21M0EL) by Dan Burns states, “The job losses suffered in March as the U.S. economy shut down in the face of the novel coronavirus pandemic were widespread but still were disproportionately felt in a handful of employment sectors and by women, the young and the less educated.” The Reuters article looks at the change in unemployment rates from February to March, and I will follow the article’s lead and look at the change in unemployment over time. My article will be different from the Reuters’ article because I will look at data from both March and April and will explain why unemployment changed more for some racial, ethnic and gender groups than others. 

The question, “Are certain racial, ethnic and gender groups disproportionately becoming unemployed during the pandemic?” is newsworthy, because African Americans [are disproportionately dying from COVID-19](https://sojo.net/articles/you-cant-address-health-inequities-if-you-dont-understand-them), and the pandemic may also be affecting the unemployment rates of racial groups unequally, according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) and Reuters. 

I plan on using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ “The Employment Situation” for March and April. The April version of “The Employment Situation” comes out on May 8, according to the March version. The March version contains the unemployment rates for white, Hispanic, black and Asian Americans in January, February and March, so I could make bar charts for each racial or ethnic group that show how the group’s unemployment rate changed over time. Once the April data is available, I can add it to the charts. I could also make a bar chart comparing the change in unemployment rate from February to April for white, Hispanic, black and Asian Americans. Dan Burns made [a similar chart](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpglnkvqd/Pasted%20image%201585934947492.png), but it looked at the change in unemployment rates from February to March. 

I hope to interview Jhacova Williams, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute who co-wrote a report titled “Black workers endure persistent racial disparities in employment outcomes.” I also would like to interview Joseph Ritter, a professor at the University of Minnesota, who co-wrote an article titled “Racial Disparity in Unemployment.”
